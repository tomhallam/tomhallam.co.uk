The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a way to describe the fleet of smart things
that are being rapidly connected to the internet. These things could be
something as simple as a smart lightbulb all the way to industrial applications
like power generation or water network management. I have proven experience in
this field, architecting and leading a team that allowed Dyson's connected
platform to suppass it's millionth connected machine.

I am able to work with you to produce secure, performant and scalable systems
that will allow you to unlock the full potential of the IoT age.
