React Native is a technology developed by Facebook which allows developers to
create mobile apps quickly and efficiently, targetting iOS, Android and now even
the Web.

Using React Native, I can hook into native modules such as bluetooth, camera,
machine learning and more to deliver an experience that is indistinguishable
from the native equivalent, often in a fraction of the time.

I have developed several popular apps using this methodology and have an
efficient way of working with it.
