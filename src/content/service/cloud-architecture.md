Are you experiencing issues when traffic is high? Are your costs fluctuating
wildly, or just too high in the first place?

A well architected cloud system can lower costs, scale predictably, improve
security and help your teams deliver faster.

I have extensive experience designing, implementing and running cloud solutions.
I am equally happy embedding into your team to define a solid architecture as I
am working remotely to design, build and hand over an application built
according to current industry best practices.

I am also able to review your current AWS architecture and provide a full
summary report of areas for further investigation. Contact me for more
information.
