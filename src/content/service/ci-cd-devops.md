Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are practices which
enforce the use of automated testing and deployment in a given software project.
Utilising these approaches properly can improve the quality of your software and
allow your teams to become more engaged and productive.

I can help by evaluating your current approach to delivering software to end
users, and providing advice and concrete solutions to improve this process, no
matter what size or shape your organisation is.
