Technical documentation isn't just about reeling off information. It’s about
relaying it in a way that’s easy to read, usable, and actually helpful for your
intended audience.

I can assist by creating, or coaching your teams to write documentation and
technical documents in a way that engages the reader and allows them to learn
about the solution rather than getting bogged down in technical jargon or
'developer speak'.
